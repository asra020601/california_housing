This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the California Housing dataset to gain insights and understand the underlying patterns in the data.

## Data
The dataset used for this project is the California Housing dataset, which is a dataset of houses in California. It consists of 20,640 records with 9 features: longitude, latitude, housing_median_age, total_rooms, total_bedrooms, population, households, median_income, and median_house_value.

## Methodology
The following steps were taken to perform EDA on the California Housing dataset:

Data cleaning
Feature engineering
Univariate analysis
Bivariate analysis
Multivariate analysis
The data cleaning step involved handling missing values and outliers. The missing values in the total_bedrooms feature were imputed using the median value of the feature. The outliers in the median_house_value feature were removed as they could skew the analysis.

Feature engineering was performed to create new features such as rooms_per_household, population_per_household, and bedrooms_per_room to better represent the data.

The univariate analysis involved analyzing the distribution of each feature using histograms and box plots. The bivariate analysis involved analyzing the relationship between two features using scatter plots and correlation analysis. The multivariate analysis involved analyzing the relationship between multiple features using heat maps and correlation matrices.

## Results
The EDA revealed several insights about the California Housing dataset, such as:

The median_house_value has a strong positive correlation with the median_income feature.
The population_per_household and bedrooms_per_room features have a strong negative correlation with the median_house_value feature.
The latitude and longitude features have a strong spatial correlation with the median_house_value feature.
## Usage
To use the California Housing EDA project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository.
Install the required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the eda.ipynb Jupyter notebook.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this project performed EDA on the California Housing dataset to gain insights and understand the underlying patterns in the data. The project used various data visualization techniques and statistical analysis to analyze the dataset. The insights gained from the EDA can be used to make informed decisions about the housing market in California.
